Time and Space Complexity (Branch and Bound):



Time Complexity:
In the worst case, Branch and Bound can explore all nodes of the decision tree, which is O(2^n ). 
However, pruning reduces the number of nodes explored, leading to an average-case complexity better than O(2^n ), depending on the problem.



Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(2^n) in the worst case due to the storage of nodes in the priority queue.


Branch and Bound is typically faster than brute-force approaches, but the complexity remains exponential in the worst case.
