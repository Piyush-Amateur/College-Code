Time Complexity
For the n-Queens problem:

Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n!)
In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible placements of queens. For each queen, it tries placing it in one of n columns, resulting in n! possible placements in the search tree.

However, pruning with the isSafe() function helps reduce the actual search space significantly.






Space Complexity

Space Complexity: O(n^2)
The space complexity is determined by the size of the board, which is n√ón. We also use a recursion stack, which can go as deep as O(n). Hence, the total space complexity is O(n^2)
